### Task
Let's solve a classic Chinese puzzle using Python! The puzzle is as follows: "In a yard, rabbits and chickens are basking in the sun. I was able to count a total of 35 heads and 94 legs. How many chickens and rabbits were there in the yard?" Hint: use a for loop to count all possible solutions! The perfect solution is a function(s) that: generally finds a solution for any number of heads and legs (if it exists) asks for the data to do so, checks the input data (e.g. text, float, negative integer), checks whether the problem has or is even possible to solve based on the data (e.g. odd legs). prints out the possible solution, solutions In this case, the number of heads and legs is the input parameter, and the number of rabbits/chickens is the output of the function.


### Task
Creating a 4-operation calculator using Python.
Operations:
addition
subtraction
multiplication
division
The ideal solution offers a menu from which you can select what operation you want to perform (selecting 1-4 is the 4 basic operations, everything else will exit),
to do this, it requests the data (referring to it according to the operation), checks the data, performs the operation, and prints the result with formatting to include both the incoming data and the result, offers the menu again.


### Task
Quadratic equation solver using Python.
The ideal solution describes what it does, offers whether we want to calculate (Yes, everything else is not)
requests the data according to the canonical form of the quadratic equation (a, b, c), see for this: https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1sodfok%C3%BA_egy√°nlet
checks the data, based on the Discriminant, writes out how many solutions the equation has and calculates them.
For the set of real numbers, it is recommended to use the Python math module for square root calculation (import math as math), while for complex numbers, the cmath module (import cmath as cmath), but this can ultimately be replaced by appropriately transforming the solving formula and calculating the real and imaginary parts separately and converting them into complex numbers using the math module). (Any solution is good from this point of view)
